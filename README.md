Urbane Ebenen Lärm
==================

(EN: Urban Layers Noise)  

![](uelaerm.png)  

Multitouch project by the-moron.net represented by Fabian Morón Zirfas (@fabiantheblind) and Peter Sekan (@PDXIII) students at the University of Applied Sciences Potsdam (FHP) during the class by Till Nagel ( @tillnagel ) "Urbane Ebenen" (urban layers) in 2010.   

At the time we wrote this we found it usefull to develop in Eclipse. For portability reasons I ported it from [proclipsing](https://code.google.com/p/proclipsing/) back to Processing 2.x. 
See the original 2010 google code svn page [here](https://code.google.com/p/tmn-ue-learm/).  

Also I made a license change.
